# Poker Solution

This project is mostly just for fun, my goal with this project is just to see if I can produce a better quality
online poker service than the ones already existing, and ofcourse try to make it as fair as possible.

That is one of the reasons why the project is open source and under MIT license.

Feel free to use anything in this repository, but please donate and support if you end up earning alot of money on it ^^

# FYI
I know there are certificate files in the assets folder and I know there is a self-signed root certificate there aswell, it's only used
for development experimentation so no need to alert me about it being public.
